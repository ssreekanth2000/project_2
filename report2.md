#### Confidence in the Federal government by age and year surveyed

Looking at the news on TV and going through social media, one gets the feeling that fewer and fewer people have high levels of confidence in the branches of government. In this article we shall examine how the trust levels in the various branches of the government and the press have changed over the years among various age groups. The GSS dataset has collected this data right from 1972. In the second part of the article we shall be looking at possible correlations and factors which may explain the changes in trust levels. We have examined age and year instead of any other combination of age,cohort and year because there are very significant effects caused by age and year. 

**Faith in the excecutive branch  of the government**

In this first figure we shall see the trends in how the confidence in the executive branch of the federal government has changed over the years in people of different ages. This will allow us to see any difference between people of different ages.
