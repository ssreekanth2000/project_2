## Is America working more than it was a couple of decades ago?

Sreekanth Reddy Sajjala


The number of hours the average American works per week is a hotly debated topic with many pushing for shorter work days or weeks. Many claim we need not work as much as we have done in the past. The GSS dataset has variables which have recorded hours worked per week since the 1970s. I shall explore time series graphs to look at trends in these stats. I shall also look at how hours worked changes with age, education level and income.This will help answer questions like:-


1. Are Americans working more or less when compared to the past?

2. Are the hours people put in correlated with their education level?

3. How have the hours worked at different ages changed over the decades?

I am using a slice of the GSS dataset with 19 chosen variables.

The ethical concern this project might raise is creating peer pressure focing people to work longer then they already are. This culture is visible in Japan
